# MATH189-HPC-NMF
MATH189 final project, trying to do non-negative matrix factorization in parallel

In this project, the final for Harvey Mudd College's Advanced Topics in Mathematics and Data Science, 
we proposed a novel parallelization of Non-Negative Matrix factorization algorithm optimizing for 
communication and bandwidth costs between 'n' number of Nvidia K80 GPUs. Attached is the working open-source paper.
